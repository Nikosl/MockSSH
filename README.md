MockSSH
=======

Mock an SSH server and define all commands it supports (Python, Twisted)

MockSSH is derived from [kippo](http://code.google.com/p/kippo/), an SSH honeypot.

Purpose
-------
This was developed to emulate different operating systems running SSH servers
in order to test task automation without having access to the actual servers.

Implementing Commands
---------------------
There is no documentation on using MockSSH at this point. For now use the examples 
from the examples/ directory as example.

DSL
---
Some efforts were put in trying to come up with the simplest way possible to emulate SSH
functionality. If this is a topic in your interests checkout the hy and yaml branches
and submit your insights via github issues.
